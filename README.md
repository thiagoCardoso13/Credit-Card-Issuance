# Credit-Card-Issuance
This dataset consists of credit card applicants. Our goal is to build a predictive model to identify the risk of delinquency (typically defined by the occurrence of a delay of 90 days or more within a 12-month period) using variables that can be observed at the time of credit evaluation (typically when the customer applies for the card).
